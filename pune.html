                                There is also a huge army of three wheeled rickshaws. There are some prepaid rickshaw stands at Shivajinagar, Swargate Bus Depot and Lohegaon Airport. Most auto rickshaws have a new electronic meter, whereby the tariff card is redundant. It correctly
                                gives the kms travelled and fare in exact change. This was done after a lot of protests from autorickshaw unions, probably the only city in India to have a neat and clean metering system.

                                City buses in Pune are run by the PMPML. Although the vehicles are crowded and smoke-belching, the network is very extensive. Almost all parts of the city are connected by the PMPML city buses. Major city bus stands include Corporation, Shivaji Nagar,
                                Swargate, Kothrud depot, Nigdi, Hadapsar, Katraj and Deccan. Shivaji Nagar is believed to be the busiest bus stand in the state of Maharashtra.
