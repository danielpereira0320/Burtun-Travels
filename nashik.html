                                        The Kanheri Caves are a group of caves and rock-cut monuments cut into a massive basalt outcrop in the forests of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, on the former island of Salsette in the western outskirts of Mumbai, India. They contain Buddhist sculptures
                                        and relief carvings, paintings and inscriptions, dating from the 1st century CE to the 10th century CE The site is on a hillside, and is accessible via rock-cut steps. The cave complex comprises one hundred and
                                        nine caves. The oldest are relatively plain and unadorned, in contrast to later caves on the site, and the highly embellished Elephanta Caves of Mumbai. Each cave has a stone plinth that functioned as a bed. A congregation
                                        hall with huge stone pillars contains a stupa . Rock-cut channels above the caves fed rainwater into cisterns, which provided the complex with water. Once the caves were converted to permanent monasteries, their
                                        walls were carved with intricate reliefs of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas. Kanheri caves were built in the 1st century and had become <em>an important Buddhist settlement on the Konkan coast by the 3rd century CE.</em>

                                    Auto Rickshaws (3-wheeled motors) are a common mode of public transport in Suburban and Navi Mumbai. People prefer travelling by auto rickshaws as they are <em>cheaper than taxis and are easy to hirer</em> especially
                                    in narrow lanes where it is not convenient to travel by car. However, they do not protect you from weather conditions like rains.

                                    As one of the most popular public transportation in Mumbai, it is used by hundreds of thousands of commuters every day. With a <em>low cost and fast speed</em>, many commuters depend on the local railways to travel
                                    to their offices, schools, colleges, etc. The main railway systems are the western line, the central line, the harbor line and the thane line. Nowadays with the arrival of the monorail and metro, the number of commuters
                                    has increased.
