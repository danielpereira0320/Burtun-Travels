                                        Marine Drive is a 3km long, six lane concrete road in southern Mumbai which stretches north along the coastline, forming a natural bay. This C-shaped road links Nariman Point to Babulnath, and is situated at the foot of Malabar Hill. Known world over
                                        as Marine Drive, this tourist spot has also been called Sonapur by the locals of the city. The official name for this road, though rarely used, is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road. Large crowds of people come to
                                        this place to <em>stride along the beautiful walkway and to view the stunning sight of the setting sun at dusk.</em> The scenic beauty of the perfectly lined palm trees offers
                                        its visitors an enthralling experience. Marine Drive is also referred to as <em>'Queen's necklace'</em>, because the street lights make the road look like a string of pearls and create an illusion of a necklace,
                                        when viewed at night from any elevated point along the pathway of the drive.

                                        The Bandra–Worli Sea Link is a 5.6 km long, 8-lane wide bridge that links Bandra in the Western Suburbs of Mumbai with Worli in South Mumbai. It is a <em>cable-stayed bridge</em> with pre-stressed concrete-steel
                                        viaducts on either side. The 1M bridge was commissioned by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), and built by the Hindustan Construction Company. The first four of the eight lanes of the bridge
                                        were opened to the public on 30 June 2009. All eight lanes were opened on 24 March 2010. The sea-link reduces travel time between Bandra and Worli during peak hours from 20 to 30 minutes to 10 minutes.

                                        The Gateway of India is one of India's most unique landmarks situated in the city of Mumbai. The colossal structure was constructed in 1924. It was erected to commemorate the landing in December 1911 at Wellington Pier, Mumbai of King-Emperor George V
                                        and Queen-Empress Mary, the first British monarch to visit India. At the time of the royal visit, the gateway was not yet built, and a cardboard structure greeted the monarch. Located at the tip of Apollo Bunder,
                                        the gateway overlooks the Mumbai harbor, bordered by the Arabian Sea in the Colaba district. The Gateway of India is a monument that marks India's chief ports and is a major tourist attraction for visitors who arrive
                                        in India for the first time. At one point of time, this monument represented the <em>grandeur of the British Raj in India</em>. The total construction cost of this monument
                                        was approximately 21 lakhs and the whole expense was borne by the Indian government. A favourite spot for tourists, nowadays, this monument attracts vendors, food stalls and photographers. The passing of the 'First
                                        Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry' was recorded as the first main event that took place at the Gateway of India. This ceremony was conducted on February 28, 1948, when the last set of British troops and divisions
                                        left India, post-independence.

                                        The Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, formerly known as Victoria Terminus Station, in Mumbai, is an outstanding example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture in India, blended with themes deriving from Indian traditional architecture. The building, designed
                                        by the British architect F. W. Stevens, became the symbol of Bombay as the <em>‘Gothic City’</em> and the major international mercantile port of India. The terminal was built
                                        over 10 years, starting in 1878, according to a High Victorian Gothic design based on late medieval Italian models. Its remarkable stone dome, turrets, pointed arches and eccentric ground plan are close to traditional
                                        Indian palace architecture. It is an outstanding example of the meeting of two cultures, as British architects worked with Indian craftsmen to include Indian architectural tradition and idioms thus forging a new
                                        style unique to Bombay.

                                        The Asiatic Society is the <em>oldest centre of learning and research in the whole continent of Asia</em> which was established in 1784 at the initiative of its Founder President Sir William Jones. The name of the
                                        society underwent several changes during the last two centuries such as the Asiatick Society of Bengal (1832-1935), the Royal Asiatick Society of Bengal (1936-1951) and in July 1952 it came to be known as the Asiatic
                                        Society. Since 1984 the Asiatic Society has been declared as an Institution of National Importance by an Act of Parliament of India. The library of the Asiatic Society is its most important asset and its importance
                                        lies not only in the numerical strength of its holdings but also in its rich and unique contents. The collection has been built up mainly with gifts received from its members.

                                        The Kanheri Caves are a group of caves and rock-cut monuments cut into a massive basalt outcrop in the forests of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, on the former island of Salsette in the western outskirts of Mumbai, India. They contain Buddhist sculptures
                                        and relief carvings, paintings and inscriptions, dating from the 1st century CE to the 10th century CE The site is on a hillside, and is accessible via rock-cut steps. The cave complex comprises one hundred and
                                        nine caves. The oldest are relatively plain and unadorned, in contrast to later caves on the site, and the highly embellished Elephanta Caves of Mumbai. Each cave has a stone plinth that functioned as a bed. A congregation
                                        hall with huge stone pillars contains a stupa . Rock-cut channels above the caves fed rainwater into cisterns, which provided the complex with water. Once the caves were converted to permanent monasteries, their
                                        walls were carved with intricate reliefs of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas. Kanheri caves were built in the 1st century and had become <em>an important Buddhist settlement on the Konkan coast by the 3rd century CE.</em>

                                        The Global Vipassana Pagoda is a Meditation dome hall with a capacity to seat around 8,000 Vipassana meditators (the largest such meditation hall in the world) near Gorai, north-west of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The pagoda was inaugurated by Pratibha
                                        Patil, then President of India, on 8 February 2009. It is built on donated land on a peninsula between Gorai creek and the Arabian Sea. The pagoda is to serve as a monument of peace and harmony. The Global Vipassana
                                        Pagoda has been built out of gratitude to Sayagyi U Ba Khin (1899 - 1971), Vipassana teacher and the first Accountant-General of Independent Burma, who was instrumental in Vipassana returning to India, the country
                                        of its origin. Built entirely through voluntary donations, the purpose of the Global Vipassana Pagoda is to share information about Vipassana, and spread information on Gotama the Buddha and his teachings. Vipassanā
                                        is the practical quintessence of the <em>universal, non-sectarian teachings</em> of the Buddha.

                                        Mani Bhavan is a simple old-style, two storied building on Laburnum Road, Mumbai. Whenever Gandhiji was in Mumbai between 1917 to 1934, he stayed here. It is now converted into a museum and research centre Mumbai and its inhabitants have played a very
                                        prominent part in India's unique struggle for freedom. Gandhiji was rightly proud of its patriotic and cosmopolitan citizens. Mani Bhavan is one of the <em>few important places hallowed by Mahatma Gandhi's close association</em>.
                                        Mani Bhavan, a modest two-storied building on the Laburnum Road in the comparatively quiet locality called Gamdevi, served as Gandhiji's Bombay head-quarters for about seventeen long and eventful years (1917-1934).
                                        It belonged to Shri Revashankar Jagjeevan Jhaveri, who was Gandhi's friend and a host during that period. It was from Mani Bhavan that Gandhi initiated Satyagraha against Rowlatt Act and propagated the causes of
                                        Swadeshi, Khadi and Hindu-Muslim Unity. In 1955 the building was dedicated as a memorial to Gandhiji and to the very important activities of great significance he initiated from that place. Mani Bhavan has a story
                                        to tell as it housed Gandhiji occasionally during the times when he grew in stature and strength, from an agitator to a world figure by successfully introducing satyagraha (individual as well as mass) as a new and
                                        effective weapon to fight all evil and injustice.

                                    Auto Rickshaws (3-wheeled motors) are a common mode of public transport in Suburban and Navi Mumbai. People prefer travelling by auto rickshaws as they are <em>cheaper than taxis and are easy to hirer</em> especially
                                    in narrow lanes where it is not convenient to travel by car. However, they do not protect you from weather conditions like rains.

                                    Taxis are the most common public transport in Mumbai. Though they are more expensive compared to rickshaws, they provide more <em>comfort</em>.

                                    As one of the most popular public transportation in Mumbai, it is used by hundreds of thousands of commuters every day. With a <em>low cost and fast speed</em>, many commuters depend on the local railways to travel
                                    to their offices, schools, colleges, etc. The main railway systems are the western line, the central line, the harbor line and the thane line. Nowadays with the arrival of the monorail and metro, the number of commuters
                                    has increased.
